# Sentiment-analysis-on-Twitter-Data

In this project, I have used cleaned Twitter data to perform sentiment analysis. At first, I created bag of words for each tweet by tokenizing the words, and then I compared the bag of words with a list of positive and negative word which I obtained from online. I tagged each tweet as "positive", "negative" and "neutral" and stored in a csv file using Python.
